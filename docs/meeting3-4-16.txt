- REAPL integration 
	- evaluating and executing command ("load file test.csv")
- bash scripting 
- running commands in parallel (stretch goal)
	- pipeline
- send data to machine learning algorithm
	- non-human evaluating 
- column addressing
	- retrieve column based on tags
	- data stored in JSON tree
	- accessing columns based on JSON schema (tree search faster than looking through csv)
- JSON schema
	- encoded on first line of schema
	- user able to view JSON schema as legend for columns
- transformation to get top 20 strings from files
	- finding top 20 occurrences of string
- why example CSV so sparse
	- all reports do not have information
	- still keep columns that have missing values
	- maybe removing columns with less than 1% of information, or removing sparse rows
- deliverable
